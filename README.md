# Overview

The map software that I wrote is made using Arcgis. The software is hosted in an html file. The site is hosted on my github at {https://brycenjwill.github.io/GIS-Mapping/}. This software is a map of all of the locations that sell hot chocolate in and near Rexburg, Idaho. It allows you to click on any of the locations to see yelp reviews, as well as the locations name and type.

The winter can be cold here in Rexburg, and so I wrote this software as a small project to allow me to see locations where I could get hot chocolate once it gets cold.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

For this software, I used the ARCGis portal to create the database for the map locations.

This program was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I made use of the ARCGis library for the base javascript.

# Useful Websites

* [Arcgis Main Developer Website](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/maps/)
* [Esri Arcgis Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/resources)

# Future Work

* I would like to have the map features update from a database so they can stay accurate in the future.
* I would like to add more fields to each item, such as a link to a locations company website, or hours of operation.
* I would like to add a way to filter map results by location type, such as a way to filter out gas stations.
